Blog API:
The Flask Blog API is a RESTful service designed to facilitate the creation, management, and interaction with blog posts and comments. It supports user registration and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to protected routes. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts and comments, with role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can modify or delete content. Built with Flask and integrated with PostgreSQL, this API is well-suited for building dynamic and interactive blog applications.
